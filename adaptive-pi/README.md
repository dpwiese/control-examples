# Adaptive PI Control with Python

This repository contains a simple adaptive PI control example implemented in the [Python Control Systems Library](https://python-control.org/).
A small writeup on the controller implemented in this code is available at [https://danielwiese.com/posts/adaptive-pi-python/](https://danielwiese.com/posts/adaptive-pi-python/).
A DC motor with unknown damping and inertia is regulated to achieve the desired motor velocity, as shown in the plot below.
