# Adaptive Control in the Presence of Input Constraints

This repository contains a simple adaptive control example, implemented in the [Python Control Systems Library](https://python-control.org/). The example was taken from work by S.P. Karason and A.M. Annaswamy.
Two manuscripts, both titled _Adaptive Control in the Presence of Input Constraints_ can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.23919/ACC.1993.4793095) and [here](https://doi.org/10.1109/9.333787).
A small writeup on the controller implemented in this code is available at [http://danielwiese.com/posts/adaptive-control-input-constraints/](http://danielwiese.com/posts/adaptive-control-input-constraints/).
