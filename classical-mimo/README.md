# MIMO Adaptive Control with Python

This repository contains a simple multi-input, multi-output adaptive control example implemented in the [Python Control Systems Library](https://python-control.org/).
A small writeup on the controller implemented in this code is available at [https://danielwiese.com/posts/adaptive-mimo-python/](https://danielwiese.com/posts/adaptive-mimo-python/).
The plot below shows the regulation of the two system outputs to the reference model signals, which are filtered versions of the input.
