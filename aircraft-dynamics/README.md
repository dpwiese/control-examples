# Aircraft Dynamics

This repository contains a few variations of linear models of a Boeing 747-100 for use in the [Python Control Systems Library](https://python-control.org/).
A small writeup on these models is available at [https://danielwiese.com/posts/linear-aircraft-models/](https://danielwiese.com/posts/linear-aircraft-models/).
